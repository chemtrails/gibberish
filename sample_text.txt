In an invited talk to the 63rd Annual Meeting 
of the American Physical Society Division of Plasma
Physics on November 8, 2021,[2] the National Ignition Facility
claimed[3] to have triggered ignition in the laboratory on
Sunday, August 8, 2021 for the first time
in the over-60-year history of the ICF program.[4][5] 
The shot yielded 1.3 megajoules of fusion energy, an 8-fold
improvement on tests done in spring 2021.[3]
NIF estimates that 230 kJ of energy reached the fuel capsule,
which resulted in an almost 6-fold energy output
from the capsule.[3] A researcher from Imperial College
London stated that the majority of the field agreed
that ignition had been demonstrated.[3]
In August 2022, the results of the experiment
were confirmed in three peer-reviewed papers:
one in Physical Review Letters and two
in Physical Review E.[6] Researchers at NIF tried
to replicate the August result without success.[7]
However, on December 11, 2022, the US Department of Energy
said it would announce a "major scientific
breakthrough" which was believed to be
that scientists at the National Ignition Facility
at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California
managed to trigger ignition.[8] On December 13,
2022, the US Department of Energy announced on 
Twitter that fusion ignition has been reached.[9]
